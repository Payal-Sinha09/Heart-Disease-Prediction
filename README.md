# Heart Disease Prediction System

## Description
This project is a heart disease prediction system that uses various classification models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a dataset of 779 individuals. Models included are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, LightGBM, and XGBoost.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd heart-disease-prediction
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main script to execute the models:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
3. You can also run individual models by executing their respective scripts in the `models/` directory.

### Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Contains scripts for each classification model.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
